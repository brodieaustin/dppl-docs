## Editing the docs

It's easy! Everything is written in Markdown. You can access the files through [Prose.io](http://prose.io)

Login with the Github account we used for the content creation process and get to work!

## ExpressionEngine

We have Ryan Irelan's *ExpressionEngine 2: A quick-start guide* in the Professional Development collection.

EllisLab's EE help is pretty good [http://ellislab.com/support](http://ellislab.com/expressionengine/user-guide/).


There is a StackExchange section for ExpressionEngine too [http://expressionengine.stackexchange.com/](http://expressionengine.stackexchange.com/).

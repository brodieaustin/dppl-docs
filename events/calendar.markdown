## Uploading an image for Evanced

1. Log in to the CMS.
2. Click on "Content" in the toolbar.
3. Clik on "Files >> File Manager".
4. Change the drop down that reads "Files By Directory" to "Calendar uploads".
5. Click on "Upload File" in the upper right area of the screen.
6. Choose your file
    > **Note:** Files must be less than 1 MB and can't be wider than 1000 px. I suggest installing Paint.net to resize your image. Talk to IT about this.
7. After the image uploads, click the "X" to close the upload windows.
8. Hover over the File Name, right click and copy the link (the language for this is a little different in each browser). Or you can click on the file name, which opens the image in the browser. Copy the URL from the browser. 

Now that you have the URL, you need to add it to your Evanced listing. And here endeth the lesson.

## Cancelling an event

If you need to cancel an event, please follow these steps:

1. Go to Evanced.
2. Locate the event and open it to edit.
3. Add the following after the title: / Cancelled
4. Edit the program description to read: This program [or event] has been cancelled.

So, as an example:

    Introduction to Cooking Class / Cancelled

If the event is very time sensitive, send an email to website&#64;dppl.org and ask that the site publishers update the event on the website too.

## Deleting events
When you delete an event from Evanced, it is not automatically deleted from the website's calendar. Because of this, there are few steps that you need to take to make sure that everything works the way it should.

1. Write down the Evanced ID number for the event that you are deleting. (Look at the URL in Evanced, it’s whatever comes after ID=#####)
2. Delete the event from Evanced.
3. Send an email to website@dppl.org, send the following info:
    - Event title
    - Date
    - Evanced ID number(s)

### Should you delete or edit an event?

Since deleting an event from Evanced requires a manual fix to the website, it's worth considering if you *really* need to delete the event. This is particularly true if you're needing to replace the event with an updated version. So, consider the following:

> You should try to edit the existing event as much as you can. Deleting should be a last resort.

### Deleting an event from the website

Deleted events need to be either removed or updated on the website too.

1. Go to Structure, click on “Edit” next to the calendar.
2. Search for the event.
3. Double check the date.
4. Select the item with the checkbox on the right.

For duplicate events, do the following:

1. Open the event.
2. Double check the ID number. Make sure it matches the one that needs to be deleted.
3. Close the event form.
4. Select the event and delete it.

> **Tip**: The site’s internal ID number is different from the Evanced ID number mentioned above.

## Uploading an image for Evanced

1. Log in to the CMS.
2. Click on "Content" in the toolbar.
3. Clik on "Files >> File Manager".
4. Change the drop down that reads "Files By Directory" to "Calendar uploads".
5. Click on "Upload File" in the upper right area of the screen.
6. Choose your file
    > **Note:** Files must be less than 1 MB and can't be wider than 1000 px. I suggest installing Paint.net to resize your image. Talk to IT about this.
7. After the image uploads, click the "X" to close the upload windows.
8. Hover over the File Name, right click and copy the link (the language for this is a little different in each browser). Or you can click on the file name, which opens the image in the browser. Copy the URL from the browser. 

Now that you have the URL, you need to add it to your Evanced listing. And here endeth the lesson.

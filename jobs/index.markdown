## Overview

The site has a special channel for job postings. The job listings appear in the following places:

- Jobs index page
- Listing page for each open job
- Drop down on job application

## Workflow

There are a few steps to follow for adding jobs to the site:

1. Complete the Job Template for the job.
2. Create a new job on the website.
3. For internal postings, the job has to be added to Staffnet as well.

Also, when a job closes, the uploaded entries need to be cleared from the site (see below for info).

## Adding a new job

1. Log in as an editor plus.
2. From Structure, go to the About section and expand it.
3. Click on "Add" next to Jobs at the library.
4. Fill out the fields from the template.
5. Click on "Date" and add an expiration date for the job.

A few tips for the different fields:

- Minimum qualifications should be a bulleted list
- Documents to include should be a bulleted list
- For Apply by Date and Expiration date, you have to set the time manually.

## Job descriptions

The job descriptions are uploaded to the "Job descriptions" file folder. To view or edit these files:

1. Go to Content >> Files >> File Mananger.
2. Select "Job descriptions" from the first drop down to filter the list.

### File format

All job descriptions should be uploaded as computer-readable PDFs (This means no scans from the copier). Use CutePDF or Acrobat to generate the PDF. 

### Naming convention

Please use the following naming convention for job descriptions:

    Job Title mm-dd-yyyy.pdf

So, an example would be:

    Reference Librarian 08-11-2009.pdf

When you upload the file to the site, the site replaces space with underscores.

### Upload a new description

1. Click "Upload File"
2. If the description already exists, you will be asked to rename the file. Don't change the name, just click "Rename" and the new file will replace the old one.

> **Best Practice:** Be sure that the file follows the naming conventions listed above and is a PDF.

## Removing job applications

Submitted applications are stored on the site until they are deleted. When a job closes, follow these steps to remove jobs:

1. Log in to the site as an editor plus or higher.
2. Click on "Forms" on the toolbar (if you don't have this, go to Add-ons >> Modules >> Freeform pro, then click "Add" in the toolbar).
3. You will see a list of forms on the site.
4. Click on the "Submissions" button next the Employment application form.
5. Select "Job" from the "All Fields" drop down.
6. Type the name of the job you are removing in the Keywords text box and click Search.
7. Click the checkmarks (or use the select all checkbox at the top) next to each application.
8. Scroll down until you see the Submit button.
9. Make sure "Delete Selected" appears in the dropdown box.
10. Click Submit.

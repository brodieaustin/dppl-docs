## Overview

The following style guidelines ensure that we all follow certain conventions and patterns across the site. The style guide focuses on very mechanical things like how many spaces should be in between sentences, but also focuses on things like writing style.

## Avoid passive voice

- Always use a clear subject and strong verb
- This makes text easier to read and makes writing more user centered.

*Example:*

    Incorrect: This resource can be used by going to the website.
    Correct: You can use this resource by going to the website.

## Be user centered
- Address the website visitor as “you”.
- Use “we” and “us” instead of “the library” as much as possible.
- Describe actions and processes with the user (ie “You”) as the subject.

*Example:*

    If you need a library card, you can use our online library card form

## Capitalization

- Capitalize titles of books, movies, etc
- Only capitalize the first word of page titles
- Never capitalize “library” unless it is part of the library’s name
- Text that appears as capitals on the site is not entered as capitals. The capitalization is done by the site. 

*Example:*

    Incorrect: Using Computer at the Library
    Correct: Using computers at the library

    Incorrect: FEATURED RESOURCES
    Correct: Featured Resources

## Commas

- Use the serial comma before the last “and”.

*Example:*

    I would like apples, bannanas, and oranges.

## Dates

- Use the en dash with no spaces to connect two dates.
- Create an en dash with the Symbol tool in the CMS.
- Abbreviate days of the week to save space, especially on the home page

Our preferred formats for dates are:

- mm/dd/yyyy
- Month dd, yyyy
- Month ddth

*Example:*

    5/6/2014
    January 5, 2014
    February 6th


## eBooks etc.

- Never use hypens
- Always use a lowercase “e”
- Second letter is uppercase
- We are no longer using eDPPL

*Example:*

    eBooks
    eReader
    eResources

## Headings

- Use headings, seriously.
- Using headings makes content easier to scan
- Don’t mimic headings with bold, use the assigned styles

See the HTML Elements page for more information about headings, including how to understand ordering headings.

## Hyphens and dashes

There are subtle, but important, differences between a hyphen and dashes discussed below. The important thing to note is that the *minues* key on your keyboard *is not a dash*. It's a hyphen.

> **Tip**: You can insert en dashes and em dashes with the symbol tool in the page editor.

### Hyphens ( - )

- Used to join words together, to separate dates *in files names*.
- Modern usage usually drops hyphens (so eBooks not e-books).

### En dash ( &ndash; )

- Use in date ranges.
- Use in number ranges.
- Do not put spaces before and after the en dash.

*Example:*

    2/4–2/10
    7th–8th grade
 
### Em dash ( &mdash; )

- Use to insert a tangential thought into a sentence.
- Do not put spaces before and after the em dash.

*Example:*

    I was really hungry—the grocery stores are all closed—so I just went to bed.

## Library vs library

- Only capitalize library when it is used in our title.
- When you refer to "the library", it should always be lower case.

*Example:*

    Incorrect: The Library offers eBooks.

    Correct: The library offers eBooks.

    Correct: The Des Plaines Public Library

## Numbers

- Spell out numbers smaller than ten.
- Numbers that are part of an instructions or directions to the reader should be numerals.
- Always user numerals when referring to floors in the library.

*Example:*

    There are two computers on the 3rd floor.
    You will get 2 copies of the book.

## Paragraphs

- Keep paragraphs short.
- Paragraphs should focus on one idea.
- Do not insert empty paragraphs to make space between things on the page.

See the HTML Elements page for info about effectively using paragraphs.

## Phone numbers

- Always use the following format (###) ###-####

*Example:*

    (847) 376-2806

## Spaces between sentences

- There should only be 1 space between sentences.

## Time

- Always write out times as numbers
- Use a.m. and p.m. with periods
- Do not capitalize a.m./p.m.

## Titles

- Use quotation marks around article titles
- Use italics for book titles, album titles, etc.
- Do not italicise resource titles

## Tone of voice

- Use a friendly, first-person tone of voice, particularly on pages where a specific point-of-view is strongly implied. Examples include blog posts or resource pages.


## Website

- Always refer to our site as dppl.org (ie no http and no www)

## Other usage examples

- WiFi

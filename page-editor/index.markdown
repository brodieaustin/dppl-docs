Here is some basic information about using the editing tools on the new site.

## WYSIWYG editor

For 99% of the work we’ll do on the site, we’ll use a WYSIWYG (What you see is that you get) editor. Basically you get a large box where you type in text with a command bar of different tools available to you. 

WYSIWYG editors will familiar to anyone who has used productivity software like MS Word, but also if you’ve used things like Blogger or Wordpress. They are designed to make creating HTML “easy” for people who don’t know HTML. And most of the time that’s the case.

Ever so often things can go a little haywire. If something blows up, be sure to let me know and I’ll fix it.

### Wygwam

The WYSIWYG editor we’re using is called [Wygwam](http://devot-ee.com/add-ons/wygwam). It's a very clean and easy to use editor. One think you might notice is that it really constrains the number of choices you can make. That's on purpose.

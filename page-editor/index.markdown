## Overview
Here is some basic information about using the editing tools on the new site.

## WYSIWYG editor

For 99% of the work we’ll do on the site, we’ll use a WYSIWYG (What you see is that you get) editor. Basically you get a large box where you type in text with a command bar of different tools available to you. 

WYSIWYG editors will familiar to anyone who has used productivity software like MS Word, but also if you’ve used things like Blogger or Wordpress. They are designed to make creating HTML “easy” for people who don’t know HTML. And most of the time that’s the case.

Ever so often things can go a little haywire. If something blows up, be sure to let me know and I’ll fix it.

### Wygwam

The WYSIWYG editor we’re using is called [Wygwam](http://devot-ee.com/add-ons/wygwam). It's a very clean and easy to use editor. One think you might notice is that it really constrains the number of choices you can make. That's on purpose.

Wygwam actually has different "profiles" you can set up. We currently use:

- Basic
- Slim
- Slimmer

## Trust the site, embrace constraint

People often build simple tools and like simple tools because the tools disappears, allowing you to focus on the task at hand. Have you ever had a new fangled thing and spend too much time figuring out how it works, that you didn’t get your task done?

Our job as content editors is to create good content. Let state this again: We are creating content not designing content. 

So, when you start using the editor you’ll notice that you can’t do things like change the font or change the color of the text. This is on purpose. You have to trust the site to make things look good. This leads me to:

Whenever you use the page editor keep in mind the following:
- Text will always look plainer and unpolished
- Do not “hard code” in extra spacing and padding around text. The site will space paragraphs, lists, etc, in a harmonious way.

## The tools
Okay, let’s talk a little bit about the tools that are available to you. The editor has the following tools:

- Bold
- Italics
- Paste plain text
- Numbered list
- Bullet list
- Blockquote
- Generic div (don’t worry about it)
- Link
- Anchor
- Table
- Embed Media
- Styles dropdown
- Source

Please see the “HTML Elements” page for more information about why and when to use some of these different element. In this section, we’ll focus on some of other tools available here.

### Paste from text
If you need to paste in text, you can do it with one of these two buttons. Please avoid pasting directly from Word. Bad things can happen because Word piles on a whole lot of extra stuff we don’t nee. Wygwam does a pretty good job of cleaning it up, but it’s best not to tempt fate.

If you need to write a draft of something, I would encourage that you just use Notepad (Start >> Notepad). It’s a plain text editor. Plain text is always the way to go. Once you paste it in you can add styling.

### Link

The link tool has a number of options. I’ll highlight the key ones.
You can create a number of different types of links, including links to pages in the website (Structure pages)

Add additional information to the link in the Advanced tab, including the optional "arrow" class under "Stylesheet Classes."

### Source

The Source button is kind of the like the “MARC Record” view in the library catalog. It lets you see the structure, raw “data” behind the pretty formatted data. The Source button is handy for me to fix weird errors and things like that. Unless you are VERY comfortable with HTML, I would avoid going here.

## Basic editing tasks

For most of the basic editing tasks you do the following:

- Create a piece of text
- Highlight it
- Press one of the tools to format the text.

It really is that easy. Here are a more few specific pieces of info:

### Bold & italic

For bold and italics, you can press the buttons or use CTRL + B and CTRL + I just like you do in Word. (Remember to use bold judiciously, if at all).

### Lists

When you create a list, the list will continue adding new elements until you hit Enter twice.

### Links

Be sure to highlight the text you want to be link text then click the link button. You undo a link by clicking the “Unlink” button (chain with a X)

### Styles

Remember never to add bold or italics to the Heading styles in the dropdown. It is not necessary.

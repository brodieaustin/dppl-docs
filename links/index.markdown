## Overview

This section deals with a few things related to links. First, how to create links with the CMS. Second, types of links you might want to use for different content types.

## Writing good links

- Use the full name of the site, not the url
- Do not use “click here”
- If not using  the site name, link text should indicate the type of content that is being linked to:

**Examples:**

Visit the [Center of Concern](#) for details.

Here is a [good of list of books](#) for kids.

## Adding links

In the CMS, you will most often create links by doing the following:

1. Open up a page or blog post to edit.
2. Type out text for the link (using the tips above for writing good links, of course).


## Events

### Creating links to calendar age groups and event types

All of the URLs that the website calendar displays can be copied and shared. There also is functionality available through the URLs that isn't available through the site. 

What does this mean? Probably the most notable thing is that you can "chain" together age group and event type filters.

Normally, when you are on the calendar page and you click on the "Adult" filter, you get a URL that looks like:

    http://dppl.org/calendar/category/adults

Likewise, if you click on an event type filter, you might get:

    http://dppl.org/calendar/category/book-discussion

This event type filter will show book discussions for any age group. So, what do you do if you want to see only adult book discussions? You can create a URL like this:

    http://dppl.org/calendar/category/adults/book-discussion

> **Tip:** The order doesn't really matter, but I think it looks nicer to put the age group filter first, followed by the event type.

### Creating direct links to Evanced events
For linking to a specific event in the Evanced calendar

1. Find the event on the calendar and view it
2. Only grab the following parts of the url: http://calendar.dppl.org/evanced/lib/eventsignup.asp?ID=#####
3. Provide a return location if you are linking to a specific event from a blog post or the DPPL website: 

        http://calendar.dppl.org/evanced/lib/eventsignup.asp?ID=####&ret=PLACE

### Examples:

Link to a YS program:<br />http://calendar.dppl.org/evanced/lib/eventsignup.asp?ID=22135

Link to program with a return location:<br />http://calendar.dppl.org/evanced/lib/eventsignup.asp?ID=22135&ret=http://dppl.org

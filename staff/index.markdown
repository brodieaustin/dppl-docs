## Overview

We keep information about staff separate from member accounts. So, whenever someone appears on the site, they have an entry in the Staff channel. We'll look at adding someone to the staff channel, removing them, etc.

Info from the staff channel appears on blog posts, managed by on pages, and the staff page.

## Staff channel fields

The staff channel contains the following fields:

- Title: This shoudl be the person's first and last name
- First name
- Last name
- Job title
- Email address
- Head shot
- Biographic blurb: This is only needed for admin/department heads
- Categories: Used to indicate what kind of staff person this is and what their responsibilities are.

## Staff head shots

Every staff profile requires headshots uploaded to the site, but they only show up for admin, site editors, and bloggers.

There is a template in the Web Services department drive for creating the pictures for the site. Here are some basic requirements:

- 400px x 400px
- 300 ppi

The image should be arranged to look good in a circle. The images should **not** be uploaded as circles though. Upload them as squares.

Images are best when taken in bright places. The backgrounds should be blurred out with depth of field as much as possible.

## Adding a staff member

> **Remember:** Before you create a new staff person, be sure to have their picture taken!

1. Login to the site as a publisher.
2. From Structure, scroll down to About / Staff.
3. Click on "Add".
4. Fill out the form with the required info.
5. Upload the staff photos.
6. Select the appropriate categories for the person.
7. Submit to save.

### Which categories do I use?



## Removing a staff member

There are two things to account for when someone leaves that dictates what we do with their staff profile:

**Did they write blog posts?** 

If the answer is "yes", then **do not** delete their entry in the Staff channel. Instead, just unselect their categories.

If the answer is "no", then they can be deleted.

> **Remember:** Editing or deleting their Staff channel entry has nothing to do with their actual member login. Those should always be removed after a person stops working at the library.

The first thing to do is to update the pages that they manage.

To delete their entry, do the following:

1. Log in to the site as a publisher. 
2. Go to About / Staff and click "Edit".
3. Click the checkbox to the right of their row.
4. Scroll down and select "Delete selected" from the dropdown box.
5. Click "Submit"

If you are just editing the record, then open the record and unselect the categories then select the "Inactive" category. Submit to save.

## Overview

Resources get listed in the Resource channel. They appear on the "All" list and on subject pages.

## Workflow

1. Determine if the resource requires EZProxy.
2. If so, have the link added to the EZproxy configuration file (see IT for this).
3. Create a description.
4. Determine which subject pages it should appear on.
5. Add resource to Resource channel.
6. Assign resource to subject pages.

## Adding or editing a resource

1. Login to the CMS.
2. From Strucutre, find Resources.
3. Click "Add" or "Edit" next to All resources.
4. For editing, search for the resource to edit and select it.

There are a few things to note:

- The URL **should not** contain the EZproxy link. Use the EZproxy slide switch to turn EZProxy on or off.
- If a resources will appear on multiple pages, try to make the description broad enough so that it makes sense in multiple places.

## Deleting a resource

Before you delete resource, I would recommend closing it first:

1. Find the resource to edit.
2. Open it. 
3. Change the status 

1. Repeat the steps above for adding/editing a resource. Be sure to click on "Edit"
2. Search for the resource.
3. Click the checkmark to the far right.
4. Choose "Delete" from the dropdown at the bottom right of the list.
5. Click on Submit

## Editing a subject page

### Adding links to the footer

## Creating a new subject page

A publisher will need to create a new subject page. Here is how it is done:

1. Login with a publisher account.
2. From Structure, add a new child page to the Subjects or Kids' Subjects
3. Choose "Subject" as the page type from the prompt.
4. Enter the required information.
5. Click on "Categories". 
6. Check off whehter or not the category is an Adult or Kids subject
7. Save your changes.

Now to actually add resources to the page, repeat the stages above for Adding or editing a resource. To actually add the resource to the subjet page:

1. Open up the resource to edit.
2. Scroll down to the lists of subejct pages.
3. Click on the Subject you want the resource to appear on. It will move from the left column to the right column.
4. You remove a subject by clicking on it from the right hand side.

## Creating multiple listings for a resource

Many of our resources are multi-facted and can be used for many different things. It might be tempting to list a database multiple times, especially to create unique descriptions. This is not the right way to proceed. Instead, the following principle applies:

> We treat unique URLS like unique resources.

In other words, if there are unique URLS that point to the different uses of the database, then there is a compelling reason to llist the resource multiple times using the unique URLS. 

In general, however, the following also applies:

> Do not create multiple entries with the same URL for the sake of unique descriptions.

Why? Well, think about how much duplication and redundancy it would create if you tried to capture all of the complexity of some of the resources we subscribe to. You could easily end up with a database listed 10 times that contains basically the same information. If a URL to the resource changes, it needs to be updated 10 times. 

In other words, use the old programming adage, DRY: do not repeat yourself.

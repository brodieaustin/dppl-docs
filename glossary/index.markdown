## Assets

Assets refer to things that can be used in many places on the site. Currently we have the following types of content available in the assets tab:

- Annoucenments (publishers only)
- Blog posts
- Homepage sub-features (publishers only)
- School

## Channel

ExpressionEngine uses the term "channel" to refer to any type of data that you are storing and displaying on your site. Each channel should be a unique type of data or information and have unique fields for that data. In EE, pages themselves are a channel, which is kind of interesting. But we also have channels for things like jobs, events, tax forms, schools, etc.

## Structure

Structure refers to a couple of different things. First, it's an ExpressionEngine module that creates a very dynamic view of your site's structure. It manages page order, page relationships, and feeds in to the navigation (not 100% though). Second, it refers to a section of the CMS where you find the site's layout and can access pages to edit. The site is set up so that Structure is the default "page" you see whenever you open the site, finish edit something etc.

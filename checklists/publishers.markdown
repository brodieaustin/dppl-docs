## Overview

So, you got a notification that something has been changed on the website. Now what? Use this checklist to help review the page.

## Checklist

### Design

- [ ] Big intro text is not being used on internal pages.
- [ ] Footers are linked to external or related content (ie not being used for calls to action, that's an intruder).
- [ ] Hero and full-width images are properly sized (usually 2 to 1 ratio for height and width (ie a rectangle)).

### Functionality

- [ ] Links to internal pages are "Structure" links and not "URL" links.
- [ ] Intruders and images are using the {thing-#} syntax and are visible in the content (This won't be an issue if the image or intruder is being hidden intentionally).

### Formatting

- [ ] No extra paragraphs breaks between elements on the page.
- [ ] Titles of books, movies, etc are italicized.
- [ ] Ellipses and dashes are using the right special characters (use the "Insert Special Character" button for this).
- [ ] Bold text isn't being abused.

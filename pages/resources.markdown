##Editing Resources Subject Pages

Resources pages are hybrid pages; as subject categories are assigned to a particular resource, the CMS will automatically display that resource on its respective subject page(s), but page managers can add additional resources to a "Try these websites too" block as well as use the Intruder feature to place highlighted content on the page. Below are instructions on how these sections are managed. Please keep in mind as you are adding content to a page that as lists of items get longer, it becomes more difficult for a person to read and process the list, so any additional content added to a Resources page should only supplement gaps in coverage through our subscribed resources.

###Intruder
Adding an Intruder box is a two part process; first you create the Intruder using the Intruder Content Box table, then place the intruder into the Main Content box for the page.  For more information on when or why to use Intruders, please see the [Intruders markdown page](intruders.markdown).

###"Try these websites too" block
For some pages, we have only a few resources that the library subscribes to. If the subject page you are managing only has a few resources that the library subscribes to, and there are additional free resources available on the web that you would like to point patrons to, you can create a "Try these websites too" block. To create this block:

1. Scroll down to the bottom of the page management page
2. Click the black triangle to the left of Content Footer Headline so that it points downward and expands to display the field
3. Type 'Try these websites too' into the Content Footer Headline field.
4. Click the Bulleted list icon in the Editor toolbar. 
5. Type the name(s) of the site(s) you wish to link to. 
6. Repeating for each web resource, highlight the name of the site, then click the Link button on the Editor toolbar. 
7. Enter the URL of the web source into the URL field in the window that pops open, then click OK. 
8. Click Save and Preview to see how your page will display. Make any additional edits needed.
9. Once you are satisfied with the page, click the Submit for Approval button.

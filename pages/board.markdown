## Overview

Information about the board can be found under the About section of the website. We have two pages with Board info:

- Board of Trustees
- Board meetings & minutes

The Board of Trustees page contains basic info about board members and meeting announcements. The Board meetings page contains links to downloadable versions of minutes, financials, etc.

## Workflow

Here is the basic workflow that needs to be followed each month after a board meeting:

- Update announcment intruder and remove Download button.
- Upload and add links for approved minutes and financials.

Then before a board meeting:

- Upload the upcoming agenda and add a download button to the intruder.

## Updating Meeting & minutes page

There are a few times when you need to update the Meetings and minutes page:

Please use the following naming convention:

So an example would be:

    Board Agenda 2014-03.pdf

Note that there is a hyphen in between the year and the month. When the file is upload the the site, the spaces are replaced by underscores. You don't need to insert them yourself.

### Vimeo uploads

The Vimeo video is just a regular URL link to the video. You can find our videos at [http://vimeo.com/user4284312](http://vimeo.com/user4284312).

## End of the year housekeeping

### Compiled board documents

At the end of the each year, compile that year's materials into one large PDF. This will need to be done with Acrobat Pro or another program that can compile PDFs into one file. Then you can:

1. Log in the site
2. From Structure, go to About >> Board of Trustess >> Board meetings & minutes
3. Open the page.
4. Find the "Past Years" heading in the Main Content area.
5. Add a year to the list (reverse chronological order)
6. Highlight the year, click on the Link button.
7. Click on "Browse Server".
8. Select the Board Documents folder.
9. Click on "Upload File"

### Delete that year's files

Ideally, when housekeeping, you would go in a delete that year's individual files. This won't be immediately necessary, but over the course of a few years, these files could really add up!

Intruders are the fancy callout boxes that appear on certain pages. It’s important to understand why and how to use intruders on the site.

Intruders consist of the following pieces of information:

- Headline
- Content (Shorter is better. I find long intruders to be hard to read)
- Text for Button at End
- Internal Button Destination
- External Button Destination
- Color

Note that an intruder only lives on that specific page. Intruders do not exit as a separate channel.

## When to use intruders

An intruder box is helpful because it can:

- Alert the user’s attention to a piece of content
- Make a specific call to action clear and “actionable”

I would recommend against using intruders to link to external, related content like additional websites. Use the Footer section for this.

> **Best practice:** Use Footers, not Intruders, to link to related or extranal contnet

This isn’t to say that intruders can’t go to an external site (and event listing, a registration page, a database), but the connection between the current page and the destination needs to be strong and clear.

Also, there is a limit of 2 intruders per page. I personally think that 1 is plenty.

## Linking an intruder to actions

Intruders work best when they highlight a call to action (see the Recommendations page for resources on call to action), and point to user to do something specific. So, when you are planning to use a intruder, ask yourself “What do I want the user to do after being on this page?”

If you plan to add an intruder, please do the following:

- Think about the action and the best words to “motivate” the user to click
- Think about where the action will take the person
- Contact me about the action so I can decide if we should track it or not

## Adding an intruder

You can add two intruders to a page. I strongly recommend that you only use one per page. The intruders are very visually striking, but could bog down a page, particularly one that might be light on content.

If you are creating a new intruder:

1. Open the page to edit.
2. Find the “Intruder Content Box” section.
3. Click on “Create the first one”
4. Enter the headline and content at a minimum. 
5. Add your button text and link if you are using one.
6. Once you have created the intruder, go back to the Main Content section. Find the spot where you want to put the intruder. 

7. Once you find a spot just type:

    > `{intruder-#}`

    Where # coorresponds to the row number for that intruder.

So, a full example might look like:

    Here is some sweet text.

    {intruder-1}

    Back with another sweet paragraph.

## Where to put an intruder
A few recommendations about placement

- Right below the title
- Right before a new heading
- Between two paragraphs

I tend to not like how they look right after a heading, or at the end of a page.

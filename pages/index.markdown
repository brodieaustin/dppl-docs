## Background info

Most of our pages can be found in the Basic channel or the Rows channel. To make life easier, though, we use a module called “Structure” to navigate the site, edit pages, and so on.

- Page elements
- Each page has a few key elements that are required fields.
- Page title
- Main content
- Publication date
- Description metadata

There are a few optional elements to each page too:

- Big intro paragraph
- Hero image or slideshow
- Page images
- Intruders
- Footer content

## When to use these elements

First, be sure to discuss any major changes to a page with the Web Services Librarian. In general though, here are some general guidelines for using these page elements:

- Big intro paragraph: Use on section landing pages, guide pages. Don’t use on pages inside of a section.
- Hero image or slideshow: A hero image is a large image at the top of page. Like the big intro paragraph, these are better on landing pages (or blog posts). Slideshows are best used on pages about programs, events, or other pages where pictures help 
- Page images: Image can help explain a concept or add visual interest to a page. Use them sparingly though.
- Intruders: Intruders are the colorful callout boxes you might see on certain pages. Intruders are great for highlighting a call to action. So, if there is something specific you want the person to do on a page, use a intruder. You can only add 2 intruders to a page. I would recommend only using 1 intruder on a page at a time.

For more information about using these elements, see the Design Patterns page.

## Workflow

The basic workflow for updating a page on the site is this:

1. Log in to the CMS
2. Update the page that needs work
3. Preview your work
4. Submit for approval
5. Send a email to website [at] dppl [dot] org outlining the changes

Once a page is submitted for approval, you won't be able to make changes to it. If you decide to edit it, the page comes out of the approval queue until you resubmit. 

Site publishers will get a notification when you submit the page and will review the update. The follow up email will help the publishers understand what's been changed on the page.

## Updating pages

Here’s a more detailed look at how you update a page. Before we start, I should mention that only page owners can edit a page assigned to them. Publishers can edit any page.

1. Log in to the CMS.
2. Navigate Structure until you find the page you want to edit.
3. Click on the page name.

    > **Note**: If you do not have permission to edit the file, you will see the following error message **You are not authorized to access this page**

4. Find the section of the page that you need to edit. Most of the time this will be the “Main Content” section.

See the documentation on the [Page Editor](/page-editor) for a refresher about how to use the editor. The [HTML elements](/html-elements) document also has some advice about using different HTML elements effecitively..

If you are adding an image, be sure to follow the instructions located in the CMS and on the Images page of the documentation.

If you are adding an intruder, be sure see the Intruders page of the documentation.

Once you’ve made your changes, you have a few options:

- Save and preview: Saves a draft of the page and opens a preview window
- Save and close: Saves the page as a draft and closes it
- Submit for approval: Alerts site publishers that a page needs to be published.

When the page is undergoing review, it is not available to edit, unless you want to reopen it and create a new draft. Don't forget to send a follow up email to website [at] dppl [dot] org outlining the changes you made (brief is fine).

*Please understand that the work you submit is subject to review and edit. I’ll strive to not overly edit content without consulting you, but some silent corrections may be made, particularly when it comes to HTML markup and formatting.*

## Updating metadata

If you make substantial changes to the page (and have consulted with me), then be sure that the page’s metadata reflects the changes. In particular, be sure that the “Description” field is up to date:

1. With the page open, click on the “NSM Better Meta” tab
2. Leave the title field blank (it defaults to using the page title, which we want)
3. Check the Description and update if necessary.
4. Submit changes for approval.

## Adding pages

Publishers have to add pages.

1. Log in to site as publisher.
2. From Structure go to the section of the where you want to add a page.
3. Click on "Add Child Page"
4. Select which channel to add the page to.
5. Create basic content for the page.
6. Update the sitemap in Google Drive with the new page.
